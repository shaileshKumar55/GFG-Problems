/*
Given n buckets and infinite number of balls. The maximum capacity of each bucket is given in an array capacity[]. Find the number of ways to fill the buckets with balls such that each bucket has atleast 1 ball and all the buckets have distinct number of balls in them.
Note: Since the answer may be very large, calculate the answer modulo 10^9+7.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 1
capacity = [6]
Output: 6
Explanation: Since there is only one 
bucket. It may hold any number of balls 
ranging from 1 to 6.

Example 2:

Input: 
n = 2 
capacity = [5, 8]
Output: 35
Explanation: If the first bucket has 1
ball in it then the second bucket cant have 1 
ball, so the second bucket has 8-1 = 7 choices.
So the first bucket has 5 choices and for each
choice second bucket has 7 choices.
So total there are 35 ways.
