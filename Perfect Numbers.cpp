/*
Given a number N, check if a number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
1 
Explanation:
Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6.
Excluding 6 their sum is 6 which
is equal to N itself. So, it's a
Perfect Number.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output:
0
Explanation:
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which
is not equal to N itself. So, it's
not a Perfect Number.
